# Supply-Chain-Management-using-Blockchain-and-IoT
Includes the IoT Aurdino Code
In an era where digital commerce continues to burgeon, the conventional supply chain confronts challenges of inefficiency, fraud, and a dearth of transparency. Blockchain, renowned for its decentralized and immutable ledger, emerges as a compelling solution to transform the e-commerce supply chain landscape. 

In conventional supply chain practices marked by centralized databases and manual record-keeping, inefficiencies and a dearth of transparency are widespread. Challenges stemming from cumbersome paperwork, delayed information flow, and vulnerability to errors hinder effective coordination, traceability, and overall operational efficiency. 

Blockchain and IoT can elevate e-commerce supply chains by ensuring transparent, secure, and automated data-sharing, fostering efficiency and trust throughout the entire process. 

We have presented an Ethereum-based blockchain and Internet of Things e-commerce platform in this paper. We describe in detail how to put in place a system that stores a product’s journey’s details on an immutable distributed ledger. This allows for secure tracing of a product’s origin. The prototype of the system is deployed and tested on Hardhat testing framework. Traditional databases and cloud storages have been replaced by blockchain and IPFS. IPFS is used as the decentralized and distributed storage layer, facilitating the secure and efficient storage of credentials. 

Furthermore, the results of our experiments and security and scalability analyses demonstrate the viability of our suggested model.

We're excited to present our latest initiative: "𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗧𝗿𝘂𝘀𝘁: 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗹𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗕𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗜𝗼𝗧!"

"𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐬𝐭," aims to revolutionize the e-commerce landscape by tackling critical challenges such as transaction security, product authenticity, and supply chain efficiency. 
By harnessing the power of blockchain technology and IoT integration, our system strives to enhance transparency, efficiency, and security throughout the e-commerce supply chain.

So, how does it all come together? 

Our project utilizes Ethereum-based blockchain technology seamlessly integrated with IoT sensors. 
This combination securely records and traces product journey details on a decentralized ledger, ensuring transparency and authenticity in the e-commerce supply chain. 
Additionally, leveraging IPFS as a decentralized storage layer further enhances security and efficiency. 
Customers interact with a user-friendly platform to browse products, place orders, and track their purchase history, all seamlessly integrated with blockchain technology. 
This holistic approach empowers informed decision-making, fosters trust among consumers, and streamlines supply chain operations, creating a more transparent and accountable e-commerce ecosystem.
