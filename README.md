"𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐬𝐭," aims to revolutionize the e-commerce landscape by tackling critical challenges such as transaction security, product authenticity, and supply chain efficiency. 
By harnessing the power of blockchain technology and IoT integration, our system strives to enhance transparency, efficiency, and security throughout the e-commerce supply chain.

So, how does it all come together? 

Our project utilizes Ethereum-based blockchain technology seamlessly integrated with IoT sensors. 
This combination securely records and traces product journey details on a decentralized ledger, ensuring transparency and authenticity in the e-commerce supply chain. 
Additionally, leveraging IPFS as a decentralized storage layer further enhances security and efficiency. 
Customers interact with a user-friendly platform to browse products, place orders, and track their purchase history, all seamlessly integrated with blockchain technology. 
This holistic approach empowers informed decision-making, fosters trust among consumers, and streamlines supply chain operations, creating a more transparent and accountable e-commerce ecosystem.
